HEEG (Heuristic Evaluation for Educational Games)  
  
HEEG is a heuristic for evaluating educational games in terms of usability and game experience. The methodology is based in other popular heuristics such as **HEP**, **PLAY** and **GameFlow** and can be applied to quickly identify design problems in digital games. HEEG has been used in [GamEdu project](http://gamedu.net) at UFRN as starting point for testing usability, design and gameplay.
